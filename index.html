If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.</p>
                    <p>If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>
                    <p>The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services.
